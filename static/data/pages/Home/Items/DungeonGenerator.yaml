    description: "After scattering rooms, I triangulate their centroids. The red edges are the Delaunay graph that defines all plausible connections."

  - title: "Step 2 — Minimum Spanning Tree (Connectivity)"
    description: "From the triangulation I build an MST to guarantee a single connected layout. Green edges are the minimal backbone."

  - title: "Step 3 — Corridor Routing & Shortcuts"
    description: "I randomly re-add a subset of the removed edges to create loops, then route corridor centerlines between room doors before rasterizing."

  - title: "Step 4 — Grid Bake & Tile Markup"
    description: "Final grid visualization: red = room borders, blue = carved corridors, yellow = connectors/doors, green = empty space. This is the data the game consumes."

  - title: "Procedural Dungeon — Final Sample"
    description: "One full run of my generator: rooms + corridors baked to tiles. Everything here comes from a fresh random seed—no hand placement."
